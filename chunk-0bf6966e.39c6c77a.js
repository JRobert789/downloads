Under irregular circumstances, the calculation method of the proposed amount of customer interruption plan is: total revenue = principal * yield/cycle days * actual days (only one day after 24 hours, not dissatisfaction), that is, the amount transferred out by the user = the sum of principal+total revenue.</p>\n  <p>Example: the principal is 1000, the 5-day rate of return is 10%, and the customer transfers out after 3 days of deposit. After 3 days, the customer's total income =1000*10%/5*3=60, and the amount transferred out by the customer =1000+60=1060.</p>\n  <p>3.
